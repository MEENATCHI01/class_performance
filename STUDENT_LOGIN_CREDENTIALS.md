# Student Login Credentials

## Individual Student Accounts

Each student now has their own login credentials:

| Student Name | Email | Password |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Aravind | aravind@example.com | student123 |
| Aswin | aswin@example.com | student123 |
| Bhavana | bhavana@example.com | student123 |
| Gokul | gokul@example.com | student123 |
| Hariharan | hariharan@example.com | student123 |
| Meenatchi | meenatchi@example.com | student123 |
| Siva Bharathi | sivabharathi@example.com | student123 |
| Visal Stephenraj | visal@example.com | student123 |

## Teacher & Admin Accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Teacher | teacher@example.com | teacher123 |
| Admin | admin@example.com | admin123 |

## How It Works

1. **Students** log in with their individual email and can only see their own attendance records
2. **Teachers** can mark attendance and view all student records
3. **Admins** have full access to all features

## Testing the Fix

### Test Student Login:
1. Go to login page
2. Select "Student" role
3. Use any student email (e.g., `meenatchi@example.com`)
4. Password: `student123`
5. You should now see that student's name in the attendance list
6. Click on the name to view their attendance records

### Verify Attendance Display:
1. Login as Teacher (`teacher@example.com` / `teacher123`)
2. Mark attendance for some students
3. Logout
4. Login as a student (e.g., `meenatchi@example.com`)
5. You should see "Meenatchi" in the list
6. Click to view the attendance records you just marked

## Security Features

- Each student can only view their own attendance
- Students cannot access other students' records
- Student name is securely stored in session during login
- Attempting to access another student's URL will redirect with error message
